# Developer Utilities Webapp

This is a webapp that provides a collection of utilities for developers. It is built using Next.js and TypeScript.

The reason for building this webapp is to provide a single place for developers to access a collection of utilities that they might need in their day-to-day work. It also provides an alternative place to use private data that you don't want to share with other services.
